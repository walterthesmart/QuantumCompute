## Overview

Quantum Compute Network (QCN) is a decentralized marketplace for quantum computing resources built on the Stacks blockchain. It allows quantum computing providers to list their computational resources and users to book and utilize these resources in a trustless environment.

## Problem Statement

Quantum computing power is an emerging and valuable resource, but it faces several challenges:

1. Limited accessibility to organizations and researchers
2. Centralized control by a few large corporations
3. Inefficient pricing mechanisms that don't reflect real-time demand
4. Lack of a standardized marketplace for buying and selling quantum computing time

QCN addresses these challenges by creating a decentralized marketplace where:

- Providers can list their quantum computing resources with flexible pricing
- Users can discover and book resources based on their computational needs
- Dynamic pricing reflects current market demand
- Secure transactions are executed through smart contracts

## Architecture

QCN is built on Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts and consists of:

1. **Smart Contract Layer**: Core marketplace logic implemented in Clarity
2. **Off-chain Oracle**: Updates job status and demand factors
3. **User Interface**: Web application for resource listing, discovery, and booking

### Smart Contract Components

- **Resource Management**: List, update, and discover quantum computing resources
- **Booking System**: Reserve and pay for quantum computing time
- **Payment Processing**: Deposit, withdraw, and transfer STX tokens
- **Job Queue Management**: Submit and track computational jobs
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Adjust resource prices based on market demand

## Features

- **Resource Listing**: Providers can list their quantum computing resources with detailed specifications
- **Resource Discovery**: Users can search and filter available resources based on their requirements
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Prices adjust automatically based on market demand
- **Secure Payments**: Built on Stacks blockchain for trustless transactions
- **Job Management**: Submit, queue, and track quantum computing jobs
- **Transparent Marketplace**: All listings and transactions are visible on the blockchain

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Stacks CLI](https://docs.stacks.co/references/stacks-cli)
- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) for Clarity development and testing
- Node.js and npm for frontend development

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/walterthesmart/QuantumCompute.git
cd QuantumCompute
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Test the smart contracts:
```bash
npm test
```

4. Check contract syntax:
```bash
clarinet check
```

### Deployment

1. Deploy to Stacks testnet:
```bash
clarinet deploy --testnet
```

2. Deploy to Stacks mainnet (when ready):
```bash
clarinet deploy --mainnet
```

## Smart Contract API

### Public Functions

#### Resource Management

- `list-resource`: List a new quantum computing resource
- `update-resource-availability`: Update the availability of a resource
- `get-resource-details`: Get details about a specific resource

#### Booking and Payments

- `book-resource`: Book a quantum computing resource
- `deposit`: Deposit STX tokens into the marketplace
- `withdraw`: Withdraw STX tokens from the marketplace
- `get-balance`: Check the balance of a user

#### Job Management

- `queue-job`: Submit a job to the queue
- `update-job-status`: Update the status of a job (owner only)
- `get-job-status`: Get the current status of a job

#### Market Metrics

- `update-demand-factor`: Update the demand factor for dynamic pricing (owner only)
- `get-current-price`: Get the current price for a resource
- `get-total-market-value`: Get the total value of all resources in the marketplace

### Error Codes

- `u100`: Owner-only function
- `u101`: Resource not found
- `u102`: Resource already listed
- `u103`: Insufficient balance
- `u104`: Insufficient funds
- `u105`: Invalid input

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Marketplace (Current)

- Smart contract development for resource listing and booking
- Basic payment processing and balance management
- Job queuing system

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features

- Resource categories and advanced search
- Reputation system for providers
- Time-based resource booking
- Batch job processing

### Phase 3: Scaling and Integration

- Integration with major quantum computing providers
- Developer APIs for programmatic access
- Mobile application
- Cross-chain bridges for multi-currency support
